The **NUTRI-BOT** is a [**telegram chatbot**](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) that keeps track of your intake and takes care of your diet. It uses **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**, to recognize what you've had and in what quantity. So you can enter stuff like _"2 plate Chole Bhature"_ or _"1 Glass of Milk"_ or _"3 Roti"_ or _"3 Apples"_. It'll record and keep a history of all your intake. It then analyses your current diet and provides you with custom suggestions on ways to improve it. It can also tell you the possible threats in the future, if you continue with the same diet.

It is developed in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and is live on Telegram as [@TheNutriBot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@TheNutriBot).
